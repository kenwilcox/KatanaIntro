# KatanaIntro
Just playing around with Katana part of Microsofts OWIN

This is designed to be run as a consol application or a dll in IIS.

If the project type is Console then things should just work.

If you change it to a Class Library, comment out or remove the class Program and Main method and launch it with IIS Express (setting the path argumnet)

In theroy it should work, but I was unable to do so.
